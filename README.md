# Data Science in Sports

This is the course project for a course called Data Science and Sports, an Independent Study Module conducted by Prof. Debayan Gupta.

In this paper, we propose a method for predicting the outcomes of football matches. Our approach is based on a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. We apply a Linear Discriminant Based Classifier to gauge which statistics affect winning the most in the UEFA Champions League. This process is done by running the statistics of all teams in the Round of 16 through a classifier, and understanding what metrics the classifier uses to predict teams.
